%% MYTHEOREMS.STY - define a bunch of standard theorem styles for LaTeX
%% David J. Chase following Jon Trowbridge's THEOREMS.STY (Univ. of
%%  Chicago 1993)
%% but using theorem.sty from latex2e\tools package
%%
%% September, 1991:
%%  Initial version created.
%% February, 1992:
%%  Custom theorems added.
%% September, 1992:
%%  Added \reset@font command to \customtheorem, fixing bug introduced by
%%  the new version of theorem.sty
%% October, 1992:
%%  Added ``notation'' environment.
%% July, 1993:
%%  Added ``thmenum'' environment.
%% May, 1995:
%%  Translated to new theorem.sty macros in `tools' package.
%%
%% Added 1995/11/01:  options 'nonumber' and 'sequential'
%% \nonumbers command added for compatibility
%% 'number' and 'nonsequential' options are defaults
%% sequential numbering gives one counter for all theorem styles declared
%% here.

% Documentation:
% The ``mytheorems'' style option defines a number of theorem-like environments
% for you.  It also provides you with some control over how theorems are
% numbered.  A proof environment is also provided.
%
% The theorem-like environments are divided into three catagories ---
% Theorem: theorem corollary lemma sublemma proposition conjecture
% Definition: definition
% Remark: remark example
%
% By default, everything is numbered by section.  To change how things are
% numbered, issue one or more of the following commands in the preamble of
% your document:
%  \theoremunit{<unit>} - number environments in the theorem catagory by <unit>
%  \definitionunit{<unit>} - number envs. in the definition catagory by <unit>
%  \remarkunit{<unit>} - number envs. in the remark catagory by <unit>
%  \numberallby{<unit>} - number all envs. in by <unit>
% For example, \theoremunit{chapter} would cause all theorems to be numbered
% with respect to chapters.
%
% To suppress the numbering of all theorem-like environments, issue the
% command \nonumbers in the preamble.
